  A CQL query string with filter conditions must include anchor query with range conditions. Anchor field is `number`. 
  Filters support logic operators `AND` and `OR`. All filters should be combined in parentheses.
  Anchor will be included only if `<=` or `>=` are used in the query. Otherwise, the empty row will be added if `highlightMatch` is equal to `true`.
